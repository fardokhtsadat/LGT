##example config file
## the config file consists of three sections: 1.create_pkl_df 2.append_existing_pkl_df 3.data_selection

## in the 'create_pkl_df' section, by specifing the parameters, you can create a new pickled dataframe from your blast results.
### to create a new pickled dataframe set 'Create_df' = yes.
### 'Working_directory' is the directory to LGT file containg all the scripts.
### 'Data_directory' is the path to your blast results. you can choose mutiple paths separated by ','. 
### 'Columns' refers to the number of columns in the blast files that contain the qseqid, sseqid, and the evalue respectively.
### 'Pkl_df_path_and_name' is the directory and the name of the final pickle dataframe.
### 'Number_of_cpus' is the count of total cpus. the process of creating a pickle dataframe can be sped up by using more cpus. we suggest choosing as many cpus as the number of 'Data_directory'.

[create_pkl_df]
Create_df = no
Working_directory = /home/users/wd
Data_directory = /home/users/file1.blastp,/home/users/file2.blastp
Columns = 0,1,11
Pkl_df_path_and_name = /home/users/pickle_df.pkl
Number_of_cpus = 3

## in the 'append_existing_pkl_df' section, you can add new blast results to an existing pickle dataframe.
### to append set 'Append' = yes.
### 'Working_directory' is the directory to LGT file containg all the scripts
### 'Path_to_pkl_df is the path of the existing dataframe
### 'Data_directory' is the path to the blast files
### Columns' refers to the number of columns in the blast files that contain the qseqid, sseqid, and the evalue respectively.

[append_existing_pkl_df]
Append = no
Working_directory = /home/users/wd
Path_to_pkl_df = /home/users/pickle_df.pkl
Data_directory = /home/users/file1.blastp,/home/users/file2.blastp
Columns = 0,1

## in the 'data_selection' section, you can search the pickled dataframe for a user_defined orthogroup and a set of species.
### to start the data selection, set 'Data_selection' = yes,
### 'Working_directory' is the directory to LGT file containg all the scripts.
### 'Path_to_pkl_df' is the path of the existing dataframe
### 'Path_to_input_file' is the path to an orthogroup file
### 'Species_names' are the user_defined species. The names should be separated by ','. The names should be written based on how the sepcies' names are written on the taxonomy browser in ncbi.
### 'Number_of_top_hits' is the count of the best hits for each of the species.
### 'Number_of_random_hits' is the count of the random hits for each of the species.
### 'DB_password' is the password for the taxonomy mysql db.
### 'Output_path_name' is the path to the final output. the output contains multiple columns: 'sseqid', 'occurrence', 'mean_eval', 'taxonomy,name'
